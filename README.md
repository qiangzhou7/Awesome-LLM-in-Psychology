## 🪄 Why This Repo?

Welcome to the brainy side of AI! This repo is dedicated to collecting and celebrating everything that's happening at the intersection of **psychology** and **large language models** — from modeling cognitive processes to chatting with your inner child. 😄

If you’ve ever asked:
- “Can GPT develop a personality?”
- “What would therapy look like with an LLM?”
- “Do LLMs understand emotions—or just fake it really well?”

…then you’re in the right place.

## 💡 Bonus: Questions That Keep Us Up at Night

- Can LLMs simulate Freudian slips?  
- What human biases do LLMs reflect—and what new ones do they create?  
- Can GPT help us understand *ourselves* better?  
- What does “consciousness” even mean if the bot answers with empathy?
